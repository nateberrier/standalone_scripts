<#
Purpose:       Deploys Tron
Requirements:  1. Expects Master Copy directory to contain the following files:
                - \resources
                - Tron.bat
                - changelog-vX.Y.X-updated-yyyy-mm-dd.txt
                - Instructions -- YES ACTUALLY READ THEM.txt
               
               2. Expects master copy of Tron.bat to have accurate "set VERSION=yyyy-mm-dd" string because this is parsed and used to name everything correctly
               
               3. Expects seed server directory structure to look like this:
                  
                 \tron
                     \tron
                       - changelog-vX.Y.Z-updated-YYYY-MM-DD.txt
                       - Instructions - YES ACTUALLY READ THEM.txt
                       - Tron.bat
                     \integrity_verification
                       - checksums.txt
                       - checksums.txt.sig
                       - vocatus-public-key.asc

Author:        reddit.com/user/vocatus ( vocatus.gate@gmail.com ) // PGP key: 0x07d1490f82a211a2
Version:       1.2.3 / Suppress 7-Zip output (redirect to log file)
               1.2.2 + Add automatic launching of PortablePGP.exe to signing portion, along with associated $PortablePGP variable
               1.2.1 / Update to account for changed Tron sub-folder and new integrity_verification directory
                     + Add $OldVersion variable and associated code to display the version we replaced
               1.2.0 + Replace built-in Windows FTP client with WinSCP and add associated $WinSCP variable and checks
               1.1.0 * Add calculation of SHA256 sum of the binary pack and upload of respective sha256sums.txt to prepare for moving the Tron update checker away from using MD5 sums
               1.0.0 . Initial write

Behavior:      Deletes content from seed server; uploads from Master Copy --> seed server; checksums everything, waits for GPG signature, packs files into .exe archive with appropriate version/name; fetches md5sums.txt from repo; checksums .exe pack file; updates md5sums.txt with new hash; deletes current version from repo server; uploads .exe pack and md5sums.txt to repo server; uploads .exe pack to seed server static store; cleans up residual temp files; notifies of completion and advises to restart BT Sync
